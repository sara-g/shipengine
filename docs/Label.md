**shipment_id** | **String** | The shipment that this label is for.  ShipEngine can create a shipment for you automatically when you [create a label](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/quickstart-create-a-label), or you can [create your own shipment](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/create-a-shipment) and then [use it to print a label](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/use-a-shipment-to-print-a-label) | 
**ship_date** | **DateTime** | The date that the package was (or will be) shippped.  ShipEngine will take the day of week into consideration when setting this.  For example, if a carrier does not operate on Sundays, then a package that would have shipped on Sunday will ship on Monday instead. |

**tracking_number** | **String** | The tracking number for the package. Tracking number formats vary across carriers. |

**rma_number** | **String** | An optional Return Merchandise Authorization number.  This field is useful for return labels.  You can set it to any string value. |
